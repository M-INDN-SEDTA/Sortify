üìë Usage

Here‚Äôs how you can use Sortify to keep your files well-organized:
1. Sort files by type into category folders
Sorts all files into their appropriate categories like Documents, Images, Videos, etc.
python sort.py
This will move all files in the current directory and subdirectories into their respective category folders.
________________________________________
2. Sort files in specific directories by depth
Use the -d flag to define the depth range. For example, -d 01 will sort files from the current directory and 1 level of subdirectories.
python sort.py -d 01
Use Case: If you only want to sort files in the current folder and its immediate subdirectories.
________________________________________
3. Sort files and create subfolders for specific file types
Use the -sb flag to sort files into subfolders based on file extensions within the categories.
python sort.py -sb
This will create subfolders inside each category folder for specific file types. For example, .cpp and .java files will be moved into Code/Java or Code/C++ subfolders.
________________________________________
4. Move files from subfolders to the main directory and remove empty directories
Use the -sr flag to move all files from subdirectories to the main directory and then delete the empty subdirectories. Combine with -srm to remove all empty folders in the main directory.
python sort.py -sr -srm
Use Case: This will sort all files into category folders and then delete any empty folders in the main directory.
________________________________________
5. Include or exclude specific folders/files
You can specify which folders or files to include or exclude from the sorting process.
python sort.py -i folder1 file.txt -e folder2
‚Ä¢	-i includes specific folders or files for sorting.
‚Ä¢	-e excludes specific folders or files from sorting.
________________________________________
6. Remove empty folders after sorting
Use the -em flag to delete empty folders that are left behind after the files are moved.
python sort.py -em
This will remove any empty folders from the directory, helping you keep your file structure clean.
________________________________________
7. Save removed folders to a log file
Whenever a folder or file is deleted, the tool will log the names of those folders into a text file called SortTool_removedFolders.txt.

Example 2: Sort files within a subdirectory up to 2 levels
Sort files in the current directory and 2 levels of subdirectories, creating category folders.
python sort.py -d 02
Example 3: Move files from subdirectories to the main directory and delete empty folders

üìù Important Notes

‚Ä¢	The script does not overwrite existing files unless specified, and duplicate files will be renamed (e.g., file.txt becomes file1.txt).
‚Ä¢	If you want to sort only certain files or directories, you can use the -i flag to include them and the -e flag to exclude them.
‚Ä¢	Always double-check before using the -srm or -em flags, as they will delete folders from your file system.
